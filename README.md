# Secret Cipher: Online Steganography Tool

Welcome to the Secret Cipher: Online Steganography Tool! This repository contains the source code for a web application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages within images using steganography techniques. The app is built using Streamlit, making it easy to run and interact with.

## Features

- **Message Encoding**: Hide a secret message within an image using a custom steganography algorithm.
- **Message Decoding**: Extract a hidden message from an image.
- **QR Code Generation**: (Coming soon) Generate and embed QR codes for additional information.
- **Random Voice Lines**: Enjoy random Cypher voice lines from Valorant for a fun user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Streamlit for building the interactive web interface.
- **Backend**: Python for encoding and decoding messages.
- **Libraries**: `random`, `png`, `base64` for various functionalities.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secret-cipher.git
    cd secret-cipher
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install streamlit pypng
    ```

3. **Run the application**:
    ```sh
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Usage

### Encryption

1. **Upload an Image**: Select a PNG image to use for hiding your message.
2. **Enter a Message**: Type the message you want to encrypt into the image.
3. **Encrypt**: Click the "Encrypt" button to hide the message within the image.
4. **Download**: Download the encrypted image for storage or sharing.

### Decryption

1. **Upload an Encrypted Image**: Select a PNG image that contains a hidden message.
2. **Decrypt**: Click the "Decrypt" button to extract the hidden message from the image.
3. **Read the Message**: The decrypted text will be displayed on the screen.

## Code Overview

### Key Functions

- **encode_message_as_bytestring(message)**: Converts a message into a binary string.
- **get_pixels_from_image(fname)**: Reads pixels from an uploaded image.
- **encode_pixels_with_message(pixels, bytestring)**: Encodes the message into the image pixels.
- **write_pixels_to_image(pixels, fname)**: Writes the encoded pixels to a new image file.
- **decode_pixels(pixels)**: Decodes the message from the image pixels.
- **decode_message_from_bytestring(bytestring)**: Converts the binary string back into readable text.

### Streamlit Interface

- **Encryption Section**: Allows users to upload an image and enter a message to be encrypted.
- **Decryption Section**: Allows users to upload an image and decrypt the hidden message.
